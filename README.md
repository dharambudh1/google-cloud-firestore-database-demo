# Google Cloud Firestore Database

## Information
This is an illustrative example showcasing the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the Cloud Firestore Database. Cloud Firestore is a robust NoSQL database solution hosted in the cloud, offering seamless real-time synchronization.

## Features
Within this sample application, we provide demonstrations on how to perform various operations such as reading existing data, adding new data, updating existing entries, and deleting records from the database.

For a more comprehensive understanding of Cloud Firestore and its integration with FlutterFire, we encourage you to explore the documentation available here: https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/overview.

## Note
Due to the lack of a MacOS System, I haven't tested this project on any iOS device.
